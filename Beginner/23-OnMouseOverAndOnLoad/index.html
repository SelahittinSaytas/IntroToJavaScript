		// There are two different ways to create objects:
		// Constructor Function and Object Initializers
		// Obect initializer is a lot faster than constructor function because it is only one line of code as opposed to a whole function and than creating the object. It pretty much takes everything and squishes it together in one line

		// Constructor function: to create 500 person objects
			//Firstly, create a function
			//Secondly, create a new instance of an object

		// Object initializers: to create one or two objects of the same type

		// A method pretty much a function that uses some of the properties to calculate things by taking some of the properties by the object and makes the calculation, for example, when was Natalie born or is she going to be retired

		// Creating a new instance of an object

		// Object name with the dot "." separator and you can either write variables or properties right here OR the functions or methods right there
		// Object + . + variable/property / function/method
