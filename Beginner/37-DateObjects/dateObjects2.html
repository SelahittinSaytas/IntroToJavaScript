		<!-- Scripts -->
		<script type="text/javascript">

			// There are two different ways to create objects:
			// Constructor Function and Object Initializers
			// Obect initializer is a lot faster than constructor function because it is only one line of code as opposed to a whole function and than creating the object. It pretty much takes everything and squishes it together in one line

			// Constructor function: to create 500 person objects
				//Firstly, create a function
				//Secondly, create a new instance of an object

			// Object initializers: to create one or two objects of the same type

			// A method pretty much a function that uses some of the properties to calculate things by taking some of the properties by the object and makes the calculation, for example, when was Natalie born or is she going to be retired

			// Creating a new instance of an object

		// Object name with the dot "." separator and you can either write variables or properties right here OR the functions or methods right there
		// Object + . + variable/property / function/method


		/*
		var pie = prompt("Enter Your Name: ", ""); // A '.prompt()' box gives a user dialog such as enter your name and by default if you leave the second parameter empty just double quotation marks nothing is gonna be appearing
		document.write("Hello " + pie);
		*/

		// THE MOST COMMON TECHNIQUE IS THAT USE THE 'ARRAY INDEX' AS THE 'LOOP COUNTER' - THAT IS VERY POPULAR TEHNIQUE

		// The set interval function runs a function, however, much time you want to increment it by for example you can run a function every second or every 5 seconds
		// Set interval function is a special function

		function printTime() {
			var now = new Date();
			var hours = now.getHours();
			var minutes = now.getMinutes();
			var seconds = now.getSeconds();

			document.write(hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds + "<br/>");
		}

		setInterval("printTime()", 1000);

		// 'setInterval();' takes 2 parameters. The first parameter it takes is what function do you want to run, and the second parameter is the increment you wanna run in and this is in milliseconds, so if you write 1000 milliseconds this means one second
